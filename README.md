## 🎯 Objectives  

- Understand overall churn rate and its drivers  
- Identify which customer segments are at higher risk of churn  
- Analyze churn patterns by contract type, tenure, and payment method  
- Provide insights to improve customer retention

## 🧩 SQL Script Details  

| File Name | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **01_Create_Database_Table.sql** | Creates database & table structure |
| **02_Data_Quality_Checks.sql** | Performs missing value & duplicate checks |
| **03_Churn_Analysis_Queries.sql** | Contains churn KPIs & insights (by Contract, Tenure, Payment Method, etc.) |

## 📊 Dashboard & Visualization  

The Excel dashboard (attached in the presentation folder) highlights:
- Churn distribution by demographics and contract type  
- Monthly charges comparison for churned vs retained customers  
- Tenure-based churn segmentation  
---

## 💡 Key Insights  

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn rate.  
- **Electronic check** payment method is strongly associated with churn.  
- Long-tenure customers (25+ months) show the lowest churn rate.  
- Offering **long-term contracts** and **better tech support** can improve retention.
